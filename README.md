# Project 2

App to connect farmers to buyers directly

## Introduction

This app connects farmers directly to the local consumer market. This will give independent farmers and cooperatives ability to sell their farm produce easily and as well enable buyers to contact farmers easily.

Here's the route we will be using:

|   Route   | HTTP Verb |   Description   |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| `/` |    GET    |  |
| `/` |    POST    |  |






## That's it!

Enjoy it! :heart:
